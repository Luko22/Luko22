# Hello, my name is Laudo Lukoki

**`Aspiring Hardware Engineer`**

I‚Äôm a knowledge-hungry Mechatronics Engineering student. With this (a Readme portfolio project), I want to demonstrate some of my completed personal and academic projects.
I will also showcase some of my current real-time data sent from sensors in my room with a SQL database and PHP. 
Essentially this is a whole software project that showcases my hardware projects. Enjoy!

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª What inspired me </h3></summary>
   One of my earliest inspirations was purchasing an Arduino Uno development kit with sensors. I was amazed at how many things can be done and made with just one board. I then started encountering boards that are capable of WiFi and Bluetooth and even bought custom boards. I was forever changed. Since then I have now finished around 10 personal projects and a few academic ones, all spanning topics from a board game about math to a robot car which I can see and control from my mobile phone. The biggest difference I recognize within myself since I started is that now I have a better idea of how little I truly know. And that excites me. I want to explore through projects and learn through collaborations. I believe I am in the right path.
